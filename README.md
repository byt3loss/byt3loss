## Repos

My mind is constantly thinking about new projects. Here's just the 10% of them.

- [Zombie Relay](https://github.com/byt3loss/ZombieRelay) 🧟‍♀️ - An Alpine container for reverse tunneling remote services via SSH without exposing your host. Designed to die and rise again, just like a zombie.
- [Offensive Scripts](https://github.com/byt3loss/OffensiveScripts) 😈 - My collection of scripts, developed during CTFs, for exploiting vulnerabilities, chaining exploits, or automating tasks.
- [RawHTTPy](https://github.com/byt3loss/RawHTTPy) 🥑 - Python package to parse raw HTTP requests into an object, ready to be used to send HTTP requests with web python libraries such as requests or httpx. ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rawhttpy/) - `pip install rawhttpy`)
