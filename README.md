## Repos

My mind is constantly thinking about new projects. Here's just the 10% some of them.

- [Zombie Relay](https://github.com/0xyy66/ZombieRelay) üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è - An Alpine container for reverse tunneling remote services via SSH without exposing your host. Designed to die and rise again, just like a zombie.
- [Offensive Scripts](https://github.com/0xyy66/OffensiveScripts) üòà - My collection of scripts, developed during CTFs, for exploiting vulnerabilities, chaining exploits, or automating tasks.
- [RawHTTPy](https://github.com/0xyy66/RawHTTPy) ü•ë - Python package to parse raw HTTP requests into an object, ready to be used to send HTTP requests with web python libraries such as requests or httpx. ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rawhttpy/) - `pip install rawhttpy`)
- [Sound-CLI-Cloud](https://github.com/0xyy66/sound-cli-cloud) üé∂ - Bash script to listen to SoundCloud music from the CLI (my first bash script!)
